# CMT Project: Algal Proliferation Prediction Model

## Project description 

This project aims to develop a predictive model for algal growth in Lake Zug using historical measurements of atmospheric CO2, surface and bottom water temperatures, and
chlorophyll-a concentrations. By simulating algal biomass at different depths over time,
this model provides insight into how these environmental changes may influence algal dynamics. While simplified, this approach allows us to simulate algal growth and visualize
trends over decades, providing a useful tool for both researchers and policymakers.

### Input files

Surface and bottom (195 m depth) temperature measurements from Lake Zug, along with global atmospheric CO₂ records dating back to 1969.

### Output files

Graphical predictions showing:
- Algal growth over time (up to 2050) at depths of 0 m, 1 m, 2 m, 5 m, 10 m, and 30 m.
- Algal biomass over time at the same depths.
